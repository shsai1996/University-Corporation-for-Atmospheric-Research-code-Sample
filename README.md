# University-Corporation-for-Atmospheric-Research-code-Sample
 A simple example of a parallel program in Python using MPI (Message Passing Interface) with the mpi4py library. This program calculates the sum of an array distributed across multiple processes.

# Prerequisites:
Install mpi4py by running `pip install mpi4py`.
Ensure that you have an MPI implementation installed (e.g., MPICH, OpenMPI).

# How The Program Code Works:
1.Initialization: The program initializes MPI and sets up communication between processes.
2.Array Distribution: The full array is generated by the root process (rank 0) and then broadcast to all other processes.
3.Local Computation: Each process calculates the sum of its assigned portion of the array.
4.Reduction: The local sums are combined into a global sum using MPI's reduce function.
5.Final Output: The root process (rank 0) prints the total sum.

# Running the Program:
To run the program using 4 processes, use the following command:
`mpiexec -n 4 python mpi_parallel_sum.py`
This command will launch the program with 4 parallel processes. The processes will work together to compute the sum of the array.
